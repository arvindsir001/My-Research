                                    <p>Multimodal integration of biomedical information, including medical imaging, genomics and electronic health records (EHR), plays
                                        a central part in facilitating personalised medicine and enhancing the accuracy of a diagnostic report. Nevertheless, the centralisation of such
                                        sensitive data to be used to train AI models is associated with high privacy, security, and regulatory issues that hamper collaborative research
                                        among institutions. To handle these issues, the present paper suggests a federated learning (FL) framework with privacy-sensitive
                                        procedures to successfully combine multimodal data in a decentralised manner with low security risks. The suggested system will use a
                                        hybrid deep learning paradigm, which defines imaging data as an instance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) and tabular EHR and genomic data
                                        as an instance of a structured deep neural network, all simultaneously trained on distributed nodes without data sharing. The updates in the
                                        local model are handled with the application of differential privacy (DP), and the aggregation is afforded with the assistance of homomorphic
                                        encryption (HE), according to which strong privacy guarantees are provided. The framework was tested on a multi-institutional sample of
                                        chest X-rays, the related clinical variables, and multi-omics variables to predict sepsis. The findings indicate that the federated model has
                                        attained an AUC of 0.945 and an F1-score of 0.887, which is similar in performance to a classical centralised model (AUC 0.951) without
                                        compromising data privacy in any way. The communication efficiency maintained by the system was only 22 percentage points slower than
                                        the centralised training and was able to counter the typical inference attacks. The results confirm the practicability of developing powerful,
                                        collaborative AI models in healthcare without undermining patient confidentiality. The next generation of healthcare systems can potentially be
                                        scaled and privacy-conscious because of them.</p>

                                    <p>Identifying drug-binding domains in essential bacterial
                                        enzymes like DNA Gyrase is critical for combating antimicrobial
                                        resistance. This paper leverages transformer-based
                                        models, particularly ProtBERT, to predict binding regions in
                                        protein sequences using natural language processing techniques.
                                        By fine-tuning ProtBERT on curated UniProt datasets, we achieve
                                        improved domain identification while addressing class imbalance
                                        and overfitting. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of
                                        self-supervised learning in accelerating drug target discovery.

                                    <p>The digitization of medical records has transformed
                                        how clinicians access and utilize patient data, yet extracting
                                        actionable insights from vast volumes of clinical summaries
                                        remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a novel
                                        methodology for patient similarity analysis leveraging medical
                                        entity recognition on clinical summaries. Our two-phased implementation
                                        extracts critical medical terms from patient narratives
                                        and applies innovative techniques in similarity analysis to provide
                                        clinicians with actionable insights derived from historical
                                        patient outcomes. This approach addresses the pressing need for
                                        data-driven decision-support tools in healthcare, enabling more
                                        informed and personalized treatment strategies. Experimental
                                        results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in
                                        identifying similar patients and equipping clinicians with valuable
                                        insights for enhanced clinical decision-making.</p>

                                    <p>Skin diseases are among the most widespread health
                                    issues, and their early detection plays a vital role in reducing risks
                                    and improving patient outcomes. Unfortunately, many people,
                                    especially in rural and underserved areas, do not have easy access
                                    to dermatologists. To address this gap, we present a deep learning–
                                    based framework for skin disease prediction that is accurate,
                                    efficient, and deployable on mobile devices. Using the HAM10000
                                    dataset, which contains seven classes of skin lesions, we designed
                                    a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that achieves
                                    strong predictive performance while remaining computationally
                                    efficient. Images were preprocessed through normalization and
                                    augmentation to improve model generalization, and the trained
                                    CNN was converted into TensorFlow Lite for integration into
                                    a Flutter-based Android application. This allows real-time, ondevice
                                    predictions without relying on constant internet connectivity.
                                    Our system achieved an overall accuracy of about 83%, with
                                    recall and F1-scores highlighting reliable performance across
                                    multiple lesion categories. Unlike many existing studies that
                                    focus only on model accuracy in controlled environments, our
                                    approach emphasizes practicality and accessibility by delivering
                                    a full pipeline from data preparation to mobile deployment.
                                    This makes the system a promising step toward affordable and
                                    accessible dermatological screening tools for communities with
                                    limited healthcare resources.</p>

                                    <p>Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that is a significant problem for the world’s health, especially because of the late stage detection 
                                        and long-term complications of diabetes. This paper is about a machine learning based approach to the early prediction of diabetes using a dataset
                                        focused on the symptoms. Five supervised learning models namely Logistic Re- gression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and K Nearest 
                                        Neighbors are implemented and compared based on standard performance metrics. To address the predictive robustness, we propose a lightweight ensemble framework that 
                                        aggregates the outputs of models using soft voting and adds confidence score calibration to promote the decision reliability. The proposed method is tested on Bangladesh 
                                        Diabetes Dataset with an ensemble accuracy of 96.2 percent, which outperforms individual models in terms of balance between precision and recall. To show real world applicability, 
                                        the trained model is embedded in a user friendly web interface with the web development framework Flask, which allows for accessible and interactive screening. The results suggest 
                                        that the ensemble approach is a practical and effective solution for early risk assessment of diabetes, but especially in low resource clinical environments.</p>

                                    <p>Plagiarism detection has become increasingly challenging
                                    due to sophisticated techniques such as paraphrasing and
                                    synonym substitution, which often circumvent traditional lexical
                                    matching methods. This paper presents a semantic approach
                                    that integrates Sentence-BERT (SBERT) with Transformer-based
                                    architectures to capture deeper contextual similarities between
                                    textual inputs. The proposed framework leverages sentence-level
                                    embeddings and attention mechanisms to identify reworded or
                                    semantically altered content while maintaining computational
                                    efficiency.
                                    The model is evaluated against a baseline Convolutional
                                    Neural Network (CNN) using the Microsoft Research Paraphrase
                                    Corpus (MSRP). Experimental results demonstrate that the
                                    SBERT + Transformer combination outperforms CNNs across
                                    key metrics, including accuracy, precision, and AUROC. While
                                    this study primarily focuses on semantic plagiarism detection,
                                    it also outlines the potential for integrating authorship-aware
                                    analysis in future iterations. These findings underscore the
                                    effectiveness of semantic models in addressing complex textual
                                    similarity challenges, offering a robust, context-sensitive solution
                                    for academic and professional integrity verification.</p>

                                    <p>Authorship attribution the task of determining the
                                        author of a text has witnessed significant advancements with
                                        the emergence of transformer-based models in Natural Language
                                        Processing (NLP). This study investigates the use of Bidirectional
                                        Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and its
                                        sentence-level extension, Sentence-BERT (S-BERT), for highprecision
                                        authorship identification. By leveraging contextual embeddings
                                        in conjunction with clustering and classification strategies,
                                        a robust framework is developed to detect subtle stylistic
                                        patterns indicative of authorial identity. The system is trained
                                        and evaluated on a diverse corpus drawn from the Gutenberg
                                        dataset and enriched with contemporary texts collected from
                                        platforms such as Twitter and Stack Overflow. The proposed
                                        methodology achieves a peak classification accuracy of 90%
                                        and an F1 score of 0.84, substantially outperforming traditional
                                        machine learning techniques. Additionally, t-SNE visualization
                                        and K-means clustering are utilized to analyze and enhance
                                        the interpretability of the embedding space. These findings
                                        highlight the efficacy of transformer-based sentence embeddings
                                        in capturing complex linguistic cues for authorship attribution
                                        tasks.</p>

                                    <p>This work describes a full federated learning-based smart healthcare monitoring conceptusing advanced deep learning, privacy-preserving methods, and distributed IoT data collecting.It addresses the demand for real-time, large-scale, secure health data processing employingwearable and ambient sensors. It uses a clear process that starts with strong data preparationand then extracts important features using convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Localembeddings are encrypted and transferred to a central server. The central server builds modelsusing adaptive gradient descent, safe multiparty computation, and encryption. To be moreversatile across data types and safeguard privacy through noise addition and gradient clipping,the method involves custom model improvements for each customer. We compared thesuggested solution with centralized deep learning, ordinary federated learning, edge AI withoutencryption, and blockchain-enhanced learning. It had improved F1-score, precision, memory,specificity, and AUCROC. System-level tests indicated lower communication overhead, fasterconvergence, and higher energy efficiency. Privacy scores remained steady. These resultsindicate that the suggested framework can balance generalization, personalization, accuracy,efficiency, and real-time performance while maintaining strict privacy. This study prepares next-generation healthcare systems for privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained contexts usingfederated learning, edge AI, and secure computation. It also proposes expanding clinical andremote health tracking deployments.</p>
